/*
    Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).

    For example, this binary tree is symmetric:

        1
       / \
      2   2
     / \ / \
    3  4 4  3
    But the following is not:
        1
       / \
      2   2
       \   \
       3    3
    Note:
    Bonus points if you could solve it both recursively and iteratively.

    confused what "{1,#,2,3}" means? > read more on how binary tree is serialized on OJ.
