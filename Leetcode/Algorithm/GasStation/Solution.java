    There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i is gas[i].

    You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from station i to its next station (i+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

    Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once, otherwise return -1.

    Note:
    The solution is guaranteed to be unique.
